 ## WHAT ? WHEN ? WHY ?

This challenge is part of the web developer training @ [Becode](https://becode.org/fr/) - June 2024.

The aim of the project is to consolidate on what we've leanrned so far and more specifically to develop our Javascript skills.

Here are the full [guidelines](https://github.com/brieucdegoussencourt/Swartz-9/blob/main/2.The-Hill/1.Javascript/cookieClicker.md)

## HOW ? WHO ?

The team is composed of three people: **Fabrice, Nathaniel & Brieuc**.

We have 6 days to create an online game kinda like this [one](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).

We will work mainly remotely thanks to **Discord** and **Github**.

### DAY #1

To get the project on track we sat together, read the challenge guidelines and shared our toughts on how to proceed.

First we decided to define clear roles in order to split the work. 

We organised the team as such: Fabrice woudl tackle the HTML structure and basic CSS, Nathaniel would take care of Javascript and Brieuc would handle the Project Manager role in ordrer to organize the work.

We made a rough mockup on paper to have a general vision of the HTML document.

A github repository was created with the main files and we were ready to start.

### DAY #2

Following the "Agile" methodology we broke down the work into small steps (cards in github projects). 

This allow to have clear objectives to build up the project slowly but surely.

Everyone focused on his role.

### DAY #3

We reunited in the morning through Discord and shared our progress. 

Nathaniel was already well advanced with Javascript and Fabrice had a first draft of the page.

Brieuc took in charge the second draft of the page and by the end of the day we could publish our first version online by merging front and back end operations.

### DAY #4

After a well deserved weekend the team got back at it. We have to work on details now.

Some functionality need updates and we also start working on [HTML standards](https://validator.w3.org/), [performance, accessibility, SEO...](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-brieucdegoussencourt-github-io-CookieClicker---Nat_Fab_Bri/56jpo2ctct?form_factor=desktop)

As we are well advanced in our timeline (deadline is on day #6) we decide to add some extra option.
