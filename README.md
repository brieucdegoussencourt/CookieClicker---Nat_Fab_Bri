## WHAT? WHEN? WHY?

This challenge is part of the web developer training @ [Becode](https://becode.org/fr/) - June 2024.

The aim of the project is to consolidate what we've learned so far and more specifically to develop our JavaScript skills.

Here are the full [guidelines](https://github.com/brieucdegoussencourt/Swartz-9/blob/main/2.The-Hill/1.Javascript/cookieClicker.md).

## HOW? WHO?

The team is composed of three people: **Fabrice, Nathaniel & Brieuc**.

We have 6 days to create an online game kinda like this [one](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).

We will work mainly remotely thanks to **Discord** and **GitHub**.

### DAY #1

To get the project on track, we sat together, read the challenge guidelines, and shared our thoughts on how to proceed.

First, we decided to define clear roles to split the work.

We organized the team as follows: Fabrice would tackle the HTML structure and basic CSS, Nathaniel would take care of JavaScript, and Brieuc would handle the Project Manager role to organize the work.

We made a rough mockup on paper to have a general vision of the HTML document.

Then Fabrice and Nathaniel started to work on their local projects.

A GitHub repository was created with the main files and we were ready to start.

### DAY #2

Following the "Agile" methodology, we broke down the work into small steps (cards in GitHub projects).

This allows us to have clear objectives to build up the project slowly but surely.

Everyone focused on their role.

### DAY #3

We reunited in the morning through Discord and shared our progress.

Nathaniel was already well advanced with JavaScript and Fabrice had a first draft of the page.

Brieuc took charge of the second draft of the page and by the end of the day, we could publish our first version online by merging front and back end operations.

### DAY #4

After a well-deserved weekend, the team got back to it. We have to work on details now.

Some functionalities need updates and we also started working on [HTML standards](https://validator.w3.org/), [performance, accessibility, SEO...](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-brieucdegoussencourt-github-io-CookieClicker---Nat_Fab_Bri/56jpo2ctct?form_factor=desktop).

As we are well advanced in our timeline (deadline is on day #6), we decided to add some extra options:

- Information (tooltips) on the buttons
- Animated cookie for the auto-click and bonus (spin and a faster spin for the bonus)
